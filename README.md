# comp20003-2022-project-3
Concept:    Free-flow solver
Notes:      Not 100% original, adapted from assignment repository. Would be good as a visual demonstration -> certainly better than pr-quadtree. Code documentation is not as good. Demonstration of dijkstra's algorithm. Queues and heaps perhaps? Not clear on how to run.
